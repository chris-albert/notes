# Category Theory

### Category (1.2)
- Identity
- Composition
- Associative

### Functions and Epimorphims (2.1)
- Domain
  - Set of input values for with the function is defined
- Codomain
  - Target set of a function which all output is constraind to fall
- Image
  - Subset of codomain which is the output of a function

- Surjective (Onto) (Epimorphism) (Epic)
  - Given `f :: a -> b`, event element `b` in the codomain of `f`, there is at least one element `a` in the domain of `f`
    such that `f(x) = y`.
- Injective (One-to-One) (Monomorphism) (Monic)
  - Preserved distictness. It never maps distinct element of its domain to the same element of its codomain.
- Bijective (Isomorphism)
  - Both Surjective and Bijective
